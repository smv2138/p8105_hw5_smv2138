## Problem 1

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("hom_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Letâ€™s look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = 
    homicide_df %>% 
      group_by(city_state) %>% 
      summarize(
        hom_total = n(),
        hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
      )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample~ two.sided

Try to iterate map2 gives you 2 inputs (hom unsolved and hom total)

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
    mutate(
      prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
      tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
    ) %>% 
    select(-prop_tests) %>% 
    unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

Created a point estimate for the unsolved homicides by city state in the
US

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

    )

## Problem 2

How do you do read csv across all 20 paths? Ideally you want all 20 csvs
stored with the path next to it

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
  path = list.files("long_data")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(path = str_c("long_data/", path),
         path_expand = map(.x = path, ~read_csv(.x))
  ) %>% 
  unnest(path_expand) %>% 
  mutate(
    arm = if_else(str_detect(path, "con"), "control", "exp")
  )
```

## Problem 3

donâ€™t export mean and sd - export t test results for whether the mean is
equal to 0 (p-value and estimate are exported) (always testing the null
hypothesis that the mean is equal to 0)

plot estimate mean by true mean (filter for only results where p \<0.05,
then compute the mean )
