## Problem 1

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("hom_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Let’s look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = 
    homicide_df %>% 
      group_by(city_state) %>% 
      summarize(
        hom_total = n(),
        hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
      )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample~ two.sided

Try to iterate map2 gives you 2 inputs (hom unsolved and hom total)

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
    mutate(
      prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
      tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
    ) %>% 
    select(-prop_tests) %>% 
    unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

Created a point estimate for the unsolved homicides by city state in the
US

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the list.files
function will help Iterate over file names and read in data for each
subject using purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the
dataframe Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm
and subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any
other tidying that’s necessary

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
  path = list.files("long_data")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(path = str_c("long_data/", path),
         path_expand = map(.x = path, ~read_csv(.x))
  ) %>% 
  unnest(path_expand) %>% 
  mutate(
    id_arm = str_sub(path, -10, -5)
    ) %>% 
  relocate(id_arm)

Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time,
and comment on differences between groups.

``` r
path_df %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "measurements"
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = measurements, group = id_arm)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = id_arm))
```

The experimental groups have higher measurements compared to the control
groups. It also seems as though the measurements for the experimental
groups are increasing over time while the measurements for the control
groups remain steady over time.

## Problem 3

don’t export mean and sd - export t test results for whether the mean is
equal to 0 (p-value and estimate are exported) (always testing the null
hypothesis that the mean is equal to 0)

plot estimate mean by true mean (filter for only results where p \<0.05,
then compute the mean )

Simulating data

``` r
t_test  = function(samp_size = 30, mu, sigma = 5) {
      data = 
        tibble(
          
          x = rnorm(n = samp_size, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
        )
      
        data %>% 
        t.test() %>% 
          broom::tidy()
 }

data =
    tibble(
      mu = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
    ) %>% 
          mutate(
            output = map(.x = mu, ~ rerun(100, t_test(mu = .x))),
            results = map(output, bind_rows),
            true_mu = mu,
          ) %>% 
          select(results, true_mu) %>% 
          unnest(results) %>% 
          select(estimate, p.value, true_mu) %>% 
          mutate(
                decision = ifelse(p.value > 0.05, "fail_reject", "reject")
          )
```

Make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected (the
power of the test) on the y axis and the true value of μ on the x axis.
Describe the association between effect size and power.

``` r
plot1  = 
  data %>% 
  group_by(true_mu) %>% 
  summarize(
    decision_tot = n(),
    decision_reject = sum(decision == "reject")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    prop = map2(.x = decision_reject, .y = decision_tot, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    prop_tidy = map(.x = prop, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop) %>% 
  unnest(prop_tidy) %>% 
  select(true_mu, estimate) %>% 
  rename(power = estimate)
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Plot 1

``` r
plot1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = true_mu, y = power)) +
  geom_line()
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_smv2138_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="90%" />

Make a plot showing the average estimate of μ^ on the y axis and the
true value of μ on the x axis. Make a second plot (or overlay on the
first) the average estimate of μ^ only in samples for which the null was
rejected on the y axis and the true value of μ on the x axis. Is the
sample average of μ^ across tests for which the null is rejected
approximately equal to the true value of μ? Why or why not?
